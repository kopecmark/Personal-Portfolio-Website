I'm a Mechanical Engineer turned full-stack software developer who enjoys taking advantage any opportunity to combine the two fields together. I'm passionate about problem solving, debugging, and writing clean, semantic code.

I am always looking for more opportunities to delve into new technologies, frameworks or mathematical concepts.

When not developing amazing apps, I enjoy climbing, hiking and ski touring in the mountains.
